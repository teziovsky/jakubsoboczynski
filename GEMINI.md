# Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Jakub Soboczyński, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). The site is designed to showcase his projects and provide information about him. It is a static site generated by Astro, with content written in MDX. The styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The project is configured for internationalization (i18n), supporting both English and Polish.

## Building and Running

The project uses `pnpm` as the package manager.

### Key Commands:

- **`pnpm install`**: Install dependencies.
- **`pnpm dev`**: Start the development server at `http://localhost:8010`.
- **`pnpm build`**: Build the project for production. The output will be in the `dist/` directory.
- **`pnpm preview`**: Preview the production build locally.
- **`pnpm check`**: Run the Astro type checker.
- **`pnpm lint`**: Run ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- **`pnpm format`**: Format the code with Prettier.

## Development Conventions

- **Code Style:** The project uses [Prettier](httpss://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. There are pre-commit hooks configured with [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically format and lint files before committing.
- **Commit Messages:** The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. There is a `commit-msg` hook configured with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce this.
- **Content:** The content is written in MDX and is located in the `src/data/` directory. The content is organized by type (e.g., `about-me`, `project`) and by language (e.g., `en`, `pl`).
- **Deployment:** The project is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The `wrangler.jsonc` file contains the configuration for the Cloudflare deployment.
