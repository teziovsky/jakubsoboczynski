Here is my current list of hardware, software, and tools, that I regularly use. The list changes from time to time, but I will try to keep it up to date!

This page was created with inspiration from uses.tech created by Wes Bos.

Hardware

- 💻 Macbook Pro 2020 13" \[Intel Core i5; 16GB RAM; 256GB SSD].
- 🖥️ Acer B246HYL 24" + ART L-17GD and Dell U2415 24" + ART L-17GD.
- ⌨️ Logitech MX Keys with Logitech MX Palm Rest provide incredible convenience while writing.
- 🖱️ Logitech MX Master 2s, because there is no better mouse than the MX Master series!
- 🎧 Sony WH-CH700N.

Editor + Terminal

- I'm currently using Visual Studio Code.
- For a long time, I used the JetBrains Mono font, but recently I switched to Input Mono as a free alternative to Dank Mono.
- One Hunter Theme Vercel.
- Zed thanks to its Blazingly Fast 🚀 performance, may replace Visual Studio Code in the future. However, it currently lacks the ability to install plugins. For now, I mainly use it for quick text file editing.
- I love Warp because it strives to provide a coding editor-like experience. Its modern interface and a lot of features (including those powered by AI) definitely enhance productivity. As an alternative, I can highly recommend iTerm2 with Fig - it has never let me down!
- Zsh + oh-my-zsh with plugins (zsh-syntax-highlighting, zsh-autosuggestions, brew).
- I made several attempts with the Arc Browser, but each time I encountered some performance issues. Brave Browser worked very well for me, but since Arc received an update that resolved all the problems, it has become my main browser again.

Software

- Absolutely I can't imagine not using Raycast 🔥 You can find a detailed description of how much I use this application here! It's no coincidence that it's ranked first on the list 😎 For the purpose of app development, I have created several extensions:
- Raycast Height.
- Raycast inFakt.
- Raycast Raydocs.
- Raycast CSS Calculations.
- Thanks to Height, I know what tasks I have to do in a specific project.
- I primarily use Keyboard Maestro as a text expander, although sometimes, depending on my needs, I create more complex system automation with it.
- The transition from Windows to macOS wasn't easy in the first few days due to keyboard layout habits. However, Karabiner-Elements solved those problems. Thanks to it, the ⇪ Caps Lock key stopped being useless - now pressing it simulates pressing ⇧+⌃+⌘+⌥ keys, functioning as a Hyper Key! Additionally, I created my own Complex modifications with more advanced system modifications.
- Hazel ensures order in the Downloads folder and automatically organizes and moves files according to defined rules.
- Bitwarden remembers all my passwords 🔐
- CleanMyMac X takes care of macOS 🧹
- Insomnia as a Rest API client.
- Apple Notes as a center for notes 📔
- Hidden Bar hides unwanted icons on the menu bar in macOS.
- Thanks to Bluesnooze, I no longer have to manually disconnect my Bluetooth headphones when macOS is going to sleep 😴
- Contexts, because now I can switch between applications only from the active desktop. Why isn't this available in the system settings? 🤷🏼‍♂️
- TextSniper to avoid having to manually retype everything 🙈
- Without Yoink, moving files in macOS can be a tedious task 😡
- Apple Music - I mean you, Techno 🖤

- WD My Passport 1TB SSD.
- Seagate Expansion 1TB HDD.
