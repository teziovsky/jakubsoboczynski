Here is my current list of hardware, software, and tools, that I regularly use. The list changes from time to time, but I will try to keep it up to date!

This page was created with inspiration from [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) created by [Wes¬†Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Hardware

- üíª Macbook Pro 2020 13" \[Intel Core i5; 16GB RAM; 256GB SSD\].
- [üñ•Ô∏è Acer B246HYL 24"](https://www.acer.com/pl-pl/monitors/business/b6/pdp/UM.QB6EE.A05) + ART L-17GD and [Dell U2415 24"](https://www1.la.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dell-u2415?c=ag&cs=agdhs1&l=en&s=dhs&~tab=specstab) + ART L-17GD.
- [‚å®Ô∏è Logitech MX Keys](https://www.logitech.com/pl-pl/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.html) with [Logitech MX Palm Rest](https://www.logitech.com/pl-pl/products/keyboards/mx-palm-rest.956-000001.html) provide incredible convenience while writing.
- üñ±Ô∏è Logitech MX Master 2s, because there is no better mouse than the MX Master series!
- [üéß Sony WH-CH700N](https://www.sony.pl/electronics/sluchawki-palak-na-glowe/wh-ch700n).

## Editor + Terminal

- I'm currently using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - For a long time, I used the [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font, but recently I switched to [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/) as a free alternative to [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono).
  - [One Hunter Theme Vercel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RaillyHugo.one-hunter).
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) thanks to its Blazingly Fast üöÄ performance, may replace¬†[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in the future. However, it currently lacks the ability to install plugins. For now, I mainly use it for quick text file editing.
- I love [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) because it strives to provide a coding editor-like experience. Its modern interface and a lot of features (including those powered by AI) definitely enhance productivity. As an alternative, I can highly recommend [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Fig](https://fig.io/) - it has never let me down!
  - [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with plugins ([zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), [brew](https://brew.sh/index_pl)).
- I made several attempts with the [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/), but each time I encountered some performance issues. [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/pl/) worked very well for me, but since [Arc](https://arc.net/) received an update that resolved all the problems, it has become my main browser again.

## Software

- Absolutely I can't imagine not using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) üî• You can find a detailed description of how much I use this [application here](https://www.raycast.com/community-stories/jakub-soboczynski)! It's no coincidence that it's ranked first on the list üòé For the purpose of app development, I have created several extensions:

  - [Raycast Height](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/height).
  - [Raycast inFakt](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/infakt).
  - [Raycast Raydocs](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/raydocs).
  - [Raycast CSS Calculations](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/css-calculations).

- Thanks to [Height](https://height.app/?home), I know what tasks I have to do in a specific project.
- I primarily use [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) as a text expander, although sometimes, depending on my needs, I create more complex system automation with it.
- The transition from Windows to macOS wasn't easy in the first few days due to keyboard layout habits. However, [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) solved those problems. Thanks to it, the `‚á™ Caps Lock` key stopped being useless - now pressing it simulates pressing `‚áß+‚åÉ+‚åò+‚å•` keys, functioning as a Hyper Key! Additionally, I created my own Complex modifications with more advanced system modifications.
- [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) ensures order in the Downloads folder and automatically organizes and moves files according to defined rules.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) remembers all my passwords üîê
- [CleanMyMac X](https://cleanmymac.com/pl) takes care of macOS üßπ
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) as a Rest API client.
- [Apple Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109) as a center for notes üìî
- [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066) hides unwanted icons on the menu bar in macOS.
- Thanks to [Bluesnooze](https://github.com/odlp/bluesnooze), I no longer have to manually disconnect my Bluetooth headphones when macOS is going to sleep üò¥
- [Contexts](https://contexts.co/), because now I can switch between applications only from the active desktop. Why isn't this available in the system settings? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/) to avoid having to manually retype everything üôà
- Without [Yoink](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/yoink-improved-drag-and-drop/id457622435?l=pl&mt=12), moving files in macOS can be a tedious task üò°
- [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/pl/apple-music/) - I mean you, Techno üñ§

## Backup

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/).
