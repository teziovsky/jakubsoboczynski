title: About me
---

Hi, I'm Jakub 🧑🏼‍💻 Currently, I am a Frontend Developer specializing in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/). I try to get out of my comfort zone by focusing on exploring other technologies and paths, therefore, in addition to learning [React](https://react.dev/), [Next](https://nextjs.org/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/), I am also developing on the backend side 👀 and I create applications based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) using serverless databases like [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).

I use my free time to develop open source products such as [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky), for which I have created four (so far 😎) extensions:

- [Raycast Meta Music](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/meta-music) - manage the ID3 tags of audio files directly in Raycast,
- [Raycast Height](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/height) - integration with the Height task management application,
- [Raycast inFakt](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/infakt) - integration with the inFakt website for issuing invoices,
- [Raycast Raydocs](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/raydocs) - to quickly find information in Raycast documentation,
- [Raycast CSS Calculations](https://www.raycast.com/teziovsky/css-calculations/commands) - with commands supporting coding in CSS.

If you have an idea for another extension, be sure to let me know! You can find me on my social media 💬

Moreover, I am interested in automation, so I try to automate 🤖 ​​all repetitive activities, using various available tools.

Apart from programming, I love electronic music, so if you also like techno, especially dark techno 🖤, you will definitely find me at a festival or a local party 🕺🏼
